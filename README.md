# TFLJourneyPlannerTest
My visual studio is crashing each time I tried to run my test. However, the test was written correctly and tests should work fine and hopefully the 
TFL QAs or Devs team that review my code shouldn't have the same issue from their side. I was trying to resolve the visual studio but it is taking longer than expected 
but if you have any question or want me to clarify any part of my tests to you I am more than happy to do that
